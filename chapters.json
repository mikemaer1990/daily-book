A company of the wisest and the most deserving people from all the civilized countries of the world, for thousands of years, can make the results of their studies and their wisdom available to us. The thought which they might not even reveal to their best friends is written here in clear words for us, people from another century. Yes, we should be grateful for the best books, for the best spiritual achievements in our lives.\n\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON\n\nThere are too many mediocre books which exist just to entertain your mind. Therefore, read only those books which are accepted without doubt as good.\n\n—LUCIUS ANNAEUS SENECA\n\nRead the best books first, otherwise you’ll find you do not have time.\n\n—HENRY DAVID THOREAU\n\nThe difference between real material poison and intellectual poison is that most material poison is disgusting to the taste, but intellectual poison, which takes the form of cheap newspapers or bad books, can unfortunately sometimes be attractive.",
  "01-02": "One of the worst prejudices known is held by the majority of the so-called scholars of our time, who claim that a person can live without faith.\n\nThroughout the centuries, in every age, people have wanted to know or at least have a vague idea about the source, the beginning, and the final purpose of their existence. Religion satisfies this requirement, and makes clear those connections which unite all people as brothers, revealing to them that they have the same source of origin, the same task for their lives, and the same general final goal.\n\n—GIUSEPPE MAZZINI\n\nThe essential meaning of every religion is to answer the question “Why do I live, and what is my attitude to the limitless world which surrounds me?” There is not a single religion, from the most sophisticated to the most primitive, which does not have as its basis the definition of this attitude of a person to the world.\n\nAt the heart of all religions lies a single unifying truth. Let Persians bear their taovids, Jews wear their caps, Christians bear their cross, Muslims bear their sickle moon, but we have to remember that these are all only outer signs. The general essence of all religions is love to your neighbor, and that this is requested by Manuf, Zoroaster, Buddha, Moses, Socrates, Jesus, Saint Paul, and Mohammed alike.\n\n—EWALD FLÜGEL\n\nThe life of a person without faith is the life of an animal.",

Those who love them are baser than those who follow them.\n\n—CHINESE PROVERB\n\nThe most important question to keep before ourselves at all times is this: Do we do the right thing? During this short period of time which we call our life, do our acts conform to the will of the force that sent us into the world? Do we do the right thing?\n\nWhen I am in difficult circumstances, I ask God to help me. But it is my duty to serve the Lord, and not His to serve me. As soon as I remember this, my burden becomes lighter.\n\nWe have to fulfill honestly and irreproachably the work destined for us. It does not matter whether we hope that we will become angels some day, or believe that we have originated from slugs.\n\n—JOHN RUSKIN\n\nJust imagine that the purpose of your life is your happiness only—then life becomes a cruel and senseless thing.

(2) Do not force another person to do what you can do by yourself. (3) Pride costs more than all that is necessary for food, drink, shelter, or dress. (4) We suffer so much, thinking about what could have happened, but not about what has actually happened. (5) If you lose your temper, count up to ten before you do or say anything. If you haven’t calmed down, then count to a hundred; and if you have not calmed down after this, count up to a thousand.\n\n—After THOMAS JEFFERSON\n\nThe kinder and the more thoughtful a person is, the more kindness he can find in other people.\n\nKindness enriches our life; with kindness mysterious things become clear, difficult things become easy, and dull things become cheerful.",

Everyone will see that you are my disciples, if you love each other.” He did not say, “If you believe,” but “If you love.” Faith can change with time, because our knowledge is constantly changing.

That is why constant learning softens your brain…. Stopping the creation of your own thoughts to give room for the thoughts from other books reminds me of Shakespeare’s remark about his contemporaries whoz sold their land in order to see other countries.\n\n—ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER\n\nA thought can advance your life in the right direction only when it answers questions which were asked by your soul. A thought which was first borrowed from someone else and then accepted by your mind and memory does not really much influence your life, and sometimes leads you in the wrong direction.\n\nRead less, study less, but think more.

And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\n\n—MATTHEW 22:36-40\n\nPeople live by love: love of yourself is the beginning of death; love of other people and of God is the beginning of life.\n\nGod is love.

He saw in a person the reflection of God’s image, and, therefore, he loved everyone, whoever a person was, without regard to his life or character.\n\n—After WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING\n\nBoth people and nations must get rid of prejudices. Feel yourself talking directly to God: don’t read the book, read your soul; then a small chapel will become as big as the heavenly dome itself.\n\n—After RALPH WALDO EMERSON\n\nThere are two ways of understanding God: either intellectually or spiritually, based on faith and morality. The intellectual understanding of God is not resolute enough and can be subjected to dangerous mistakes; spiritual understanding of God requires moral actions. This faith is both natural and supernatural.\n\n—After IMMANUEL KANT\n\nBeware of everything which puts an obstacle between you and God.",
  "01-16": "False faith is the major cause of most of our misfortunes.\n\nThe purpose of a human life is to bring the irrational beginning of our life to a rational beginning. In order to succeed in this, two things are important: (1) to see all irrational, unwise things in life and direct your attention to them and study them; (2) to understand the possibility of a rational, wise life. The major purpose of all teachers of mankind was the understanding of the irrational and rational beginnings in our life.\n\nWe should be ready to change our views at any time, and slough off prejudices, and live with an open and receptive mind.

There is nothing which can be called ourselves in that land; therefore, we do not remember what has happened to us there.\n\nWhen a person leads a good life, he is happy at the present moment and he does not think what will happen after this life.

It is much better to believe that everything which God makes for us is good than to believe in all the pleasures of paradise.\n\nWhen we die, our souls become free.\n\n—After HERACLITUS\n\nA person should not think too much about what will happen after his life.

But we all do the same when we scold and blame the evil in other people instead of fighting the evil which exists in us. It is possible to get rid of the evil inside of us, as it is possible to make a roof and windows for our house. This is possible. But it is not possible for us to destroy evil in this world, just as we cannot order the weather to change and the clouds to disappear. If, instead of teaching others, we would educate and improve ourselves, then there would be less evil in this world, and all people would live better lives.\n\nDo not be embarrassed by your mistakes. Nothing can teach us better than our understanding of them. This is one of the best ways of self-education.\n\n—THOMAS CARLYLE\n\nIt seems to us that the most important work in the world is the work which is visible, which we can see: building a house, plowing the land, feeding cattle, gathering fruits; and that the work which is invisible, the work done by our soul, is not important. But our invisible work at the improvement of our soul is the most important work in the world, and all other visible kinds of work are useful only when we do this major work.",

Murder is the most vulgar violation of the Law of God as it is expressed in all religious teachings and in all people’s conscience.\n\nMilitary service makes people corrupt, because the military, in time of peace, abides in complete idleness; they lack any useful labor, they are freed of the obligations of such work. Instead, they create notions of honor of regiment, or of banner, or the complete subjugation of one person by another.\n\nWhen civilians get into these circumstances, they become ashamed of such a way of life. The military, on the contrary, are proud of it and boast of this way of life, especially during periods of war. They say: “We are ready to risk our lives at war, and therefore such a careless joyful life is necessary for us, and we have the right to lead it.”\n\nThe same divine beginning lives in all people, and no single person or gathering of people has the right to destroy this connection between the divine beginning and a human body, that is, to take a human life.",

Do not do anything: do not walk, do not move, do not speak. If your body or your tongue moves at this moment, then your rage will grow.\n\nRage is very harmful for all people, but it is most harmful for the man who experiences it.\n\nAn evil person damages not only others but himself.\n\n—After SOCRATES\n\nYour enemy will pay you back with rage, will make you suffer, but the biggest damage to you will be caused by the rage and hatred existing in your heart.

In geometry, he said, it is enough to know how to measure the land when you want to sell it or buy it, or how to share an inheritance, or to divide work among workers. He did not like too many sophisticated sciences; though he knew all of them. He said that sophisticated knowledge requires an extra effort that takes the student’s time from the most basic and the most important human pursuit: moral perfection.\n\n—XENOPHON\n\nDivert your gaze from the world of lies. Do not trust your feelings. Only in yourself, only in your impersonal self, can you find the eternal.\n\n—DHAMMAPADA, a book of BUDDHIST WISDOM\n\nIt is better to know several basic rules of life than to study many unnecessary sciences.

Thus often, especially in his youth, he is interested only in his body, but nevertheless, the most essential part of every man is not his body, but his soul. It is your soul that you must take care of, not your body. You must learn this over time, and remember that your real life is in your spirit, that is, in your soul. Save it from everyday dirt and do not let your flesh guide it; subdue your body to your soul, and then you will fulfill your destiny and live a happy life.\n\n—After MARCUS AURELIUS\n\nThe heart of the matter is whether we believe or disbelieve in the existence of a spiritual realm. All people are divided into two groups, those who are alive and those who are dead; in other words, those who believe and those who don’t. An unbeliever says: “What is spirit! … What I ate and what I enjoyed, this is what I possess, this is material and real!” And such a person, without thinking much, takes care only of the outer things, arranging in order only his own mean, dirty affairs; he becomes a liar, a snob, a slave, and does not feel any higher needs: freedom, truth, and love. Such a person keeps away from the light of the intellect, because in fact he is dead, and this light gives life only to living things, and hardens and rots the dead things.\n\n—ALEXANDR ARKHANGELSKY\n\nThe difference between the spiritual realm and the material is equally clear and obvious, both for a child and a wise man; further speculations are not necessary.",
  "02-02": "There are two different states of human existence: first, to live without thinking of death; second, to live with the thought that you approach death with every hour of your life.\n\nThe more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death. A person who lives a truly spiritual life has no fear of death.\n\nWhen you have doubts about what to do, just imagine that you might die at the end of that same day, and then all your doubts will disappear, and you will see clearly what your conscience tells you, and what is your true personal wish.\n\nA man condemned to immediate execution will not think about the growth of his estate, or about achieving glory, or about the victory of one group over another, or about the discovery of a new planet. But one minute before his death a man may wish to console an abused person, or help an old person to stand up, or to put a bandage on someone’s injury, or to repair a toy for a child.",

Only when a person forgets himself for the sake of another, and lives for another creature, only this kind of love can be called true love, and only in this love do we see the blessing and reward of life. This is the foundation of the world.\n\nNothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness.",
  "02-04": "A man is free only when he lives in truth, and the truth may be perceived only by the intellect.\n\nIf you throw some nuts and cookies on a road, you will eventually see children come, pick them up, and start to argue and fight for them. Adults would not fight for such things. And even children would not pick up the nuts’ empty shells.\n\nFor a wise man, the wealth, the glory, and the rewards of this world are like sweets or empty shells on a road. Let the children pick them up and fight for them. Let them kiss the hands of the rich men, the rulers, and their servants. For the wise one, all these are but empty shells.\n\n—EPICTETUS\n\nA distinctive feature of a thinking person is submission to his fate, as opposed to the shameful struggle with it that is a characteristic feature of animals.\n\n—MARCUS AURELIUS\n\nWe are not free in this world, subdued by our passions and by the emotions of other people to the degree that we forget the requirements of our intellects. If we really want to become free, we can be so only through our intellect.",

Therefore, to fully understand other people and other societies, we must look beyond previous events to the thoughts which gave rise to them.\n\nPerhaps it is even more important to know what one should not think about than what one should think about.\n\nOur thoughts, depending on whether they are good or bad, can bring us either to paradise or to hell; this happens, neither in heaven nor under the earth, but here, in this life.\n\n—LUCY MALORY\n\nA thought seems to be free and independent, but a human being has something stronger than thought, something which could guide our thoughts.\n\nIn order to change the nature of things, either within yourself or in others, one should change, not the events, but those thoughts which created those events.",

This desire is never sated, for the more it is satisfied, the more it grows.\n\nVery often people are made proud by their control over their own desires, and by the force and passion with which they master them. What a strange delusion!\n\nMany people worry, and suffer, because they have been involved in so many bad things in their lives. In truth, though, good things often happen in spite of our wishes, and sometimes even in opposition to our wishes, and often after our excitement and suffering over unworthy things.\n\nRemember how passionately you yearned in the past for many of the things which you hate or despise now.\n\nRemember how many things you lost trying to satisfy your former desires. The same thing could happen now, with the desires which excite you at present. Try to tame your present desires, calm them; this is most beneficial, and most achievable.",

All the misfortunes of mankind come from these three cravings. Without them, people would live in happiness. But how can we get rid of these terrible illnesses? … Work on yourself and improve yourself; this is the answer. Start the improvement of this world from within.\n\n—F. ROBERT DE LAMENNAIS\n\n“Be perfect, as your heavenly Father,” Christ said. This does not mean that Christ asked people to be as good as God; only that everyone should strive for perfection.\n\nPure perfection can be found only in God; one’s life consists of becoming closer to God. And when a person knows that good is good and that evil is evil, then he or she gets closer to good, and moves farther from evil.\n\n—CONFUCIUS\n\nThere is nothing more harmful to you than improving only your material, animal side of life. There is nothing more beneficial, both for you and for others, than activity directed to the improvement of your soul.",

It is the same with people who like to listen to the fault-finding of their neighbors.\n\nWhen two people have a dispute, both are to blame. And therefore, a dispute will stop only when at least one person understands that he or she is guilty.\n\nJudge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\n—MATTHEW 7:1-2\n\nStop blaming other people, and you will feel what an alcoholic feels when he stops drinking, or what a smoker feels when he stops smoking.

This same behavior lives in all sincere people. But very often, a man from one nation already hates a man from another nation, and is ready to cause him sufferings and even death, even before he meets him. Those who create these feelings in nations commit a terrible crime!\n\nThe most powerful weapon known is the weapon of blessing. Therefore, a clever person relies on it. He wins with peace, not with war.\n\n—LAO-TZU\n\nWar creates a state in which power and glory is at the end too often received by the most undeserving and vicious people.",
  "02-10": "The higher the opinion a person has of himself, the more unstable is his position; the lower he moves in his selfesteem, the firmer he stands.\n\nTo be strong, you have to be like water: if there are no obstacles, it flows; if there is an obstacle it stops; if a dam is broken, then it flows further; if a vessel is square, then it has a square form; if a vessel is round, then it has a round form. Because it is so soft and flexible, it is the most necessary and the strongest thing.\n\n—LAO-TZU\n\nThe more a person analyzes his inner self, the more insignificant he seems to himself. This is the first lesson of wisdom. Let us be humble, and we will become wise. Let us know our weakness, and it will give us power.\n\n—WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING\n\nWater does not stay on a mountaintop, but flows into the valley. In the same manner, real virtue does not remain with those people who want to be higher than the others; but virtue stays only with people who are humble.\n\n—After the TALMUD\n\nTry to find out your potential. After you know it, do not be afraid to underestimate it. Be cautious not to exaggerate it.",
  "02-11": "A person’s life is good only to the extent that it fulfills the expectations of the will of God.\n\nEvil, in the form of suffering and death, is everywhere apparent to a person who accepts the law of his material, animal existence as the major law of his life. Only when a man lowers himself to the state of an animal does death and suffering scare him. The only road open for him to escape that fear is the road of fulfillment of the law of God, the law which is expressed in love. There is no death and no suffering for a man who lives according to the law of God.\n\nBe as you are, as you have to be, and the rest is God’s business.\n\n—HENRI AMIEL\n\nThe fulfillment of our duties and the satisfaction of our personal pleasures are two different things. Duties have their own laws, and even if we try to mix our duties with our pleasures, they will separate themselves.\n\n—After IMMANUEL KANT\n\nWe know the law of God, both as it is presented to us by the different religions of the world and as our own conscience, when it is not obscured by passion and prejudice, and we can easily understand the applications of this law to our life, for all real good stems from its requirements.",
  "02-12": "It is obvious for everyone that death expects us all in the long run; but nevertheless we live our lives as if there will be no death.\n\nIf only God is among us, and eternity exists, then everything is different. We can distinguish good from evil, light from darkness, and despair disappears.\n\n—ERASMUS\n\nOne of the key questions we face is whether our lives end after death. Whether we believe in eternity or not determines our actions. Therefore, it is crucial that we determine what is mortal in us, and what is eternal, and that we cherish those things eternal. Most people do exactly the opposite.\n\n—After BLAISE PASCAL\n\nThe more deeply you understand life, the less you grieve over the destruction caused by death.\n\nWhatever name you give to the origin of man, this spiritual quality of humans to understand, feel, and exist, it is holy, it is divine, and, therefore, it should be eternal.\n\n—MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO",

A person can be kind only when he has an enlightened intellect. One helps the other.\n\n—CHINESE WISDOM\n\nA merchant married a princess, and he built a palace for her, bought luxurious dresses for her, and brought her hundreds of servants to make her happy. But the princess was bored. She was missing something, and she constantly thought about her royal origin. Thus it is with a human soul: you can surround it with all the pleasures on earth, but it will still be missing its home, the beginning which is called God, the place from which it has originated.\n\n—After the TALMUD\n\nEven if people do not know what real kindness is, they nevertheless have it within them.\n\n—CONFUCIUS\n\nGod lives in every one of us.

All of the mountains and rivers you see, and all the forms of life, and all creations of nature, all pass. Then you will understand the truth; you will see what remains, what does not pass.\n\n—BUDDHIST WISDOM\n\nRemember that you are not mortal; only your body is mortal. What is alive is not your body but the spirit living in your body.

  "02-17": "All people of the world have an equal right to the privileges of this world.\n\nEquality cannot be reached, as some people think, only by civil measures. It can be reached only by love of God and people, and this love can be reached, not by civil measures, but only as the result of spiritual learning.\n\nThey say that equality is not possible, because some people will always be stronger or smarter than others. But it is exactly because of this, said Lichtenberg, precisely because some people are stronger and smarter than others, that the principle of equality is necessary. The advantages of the rich over the poor demonstrate not only inequality of force and intellect, but inequality of civil rights.\n\nChrist revealed to humanity those things which their best selves already knew: that people are equal because the same spirit lives in all of them…. Learn from the small children, behave like children, and treat all people on an equal basis, with love and tenderness.",

Without work, a person cannot have human dignity. It is because of this that idle people are so much concerned by the superficial, outer expression of their importance; they know that without this, other people would despise them.\n\nWhen we accept truth and repent our sins, we understand that nobody can have special rights, advantages, or privileges in this life. There is no end or limit to our duties and obligations. And the first and the most important obligation for us is to fight with nature for our life and for the lives of other people.",

If you want to serve God, you should be a worker for the spiritual progress of humanity.\n\nThe way of life of any people depends on their faith. Faith, with time, becomes more simple, more clear, and closer to the real truth, and in accordance with the simplifying and clarifying of faith, people become more and more united.\n\nIf you think it is ever warranted to stop on the path of further understanding, you are very far from the truth. The life which we received was given to us not that we might just admire it, but that we should ever look for new truth hidden from us.\n\n—After JOHN MILTON\n\nMankind makes progress when its faith progresses. And if there is any progress in religion, it is not in the discovery of something new, but in the purifying of the truths which have been revealed and explained to us.\n\nWe should not substitute real religious progress with other types of progress: technical, scholarly, and artistic. These technical, scholarly, and artistic achievements can certainly coexist with religious backwardness, as happens in our time.\n\nIf you want to serve God, you should work on the side of religious progress in the fight against prejudice, toward a better understanding of the clear and pure religion.",

The time will come when more and more people will drop this terrible habit.\n\nIt is a mistake to believe that we need obey no moral in our attitude to the animals, that we have no moral responsibilities to them. This way lies complete vulgarity and rudeness.\n\n—ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER\n\nThe killing and eating of animals is a prejudice accepted by those who think that animals were given to people by God to eat, so that there is nothing wrong in killing them. This is not true. It may be written in some books that it is not a sin to kill an animal, but it is written in our own hearts more clearly than in any books—that we should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other.

Kind people already feel good, because they are kind.”\n\n—MUSLIH-UD-DIN SAADI\n\nIf you do good and ask for a reward, you weaken the force of your goodness.\n\n—From the BOOK OF DIVINE THOUGHTS\n\nDo not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.\n\n—MATTHEW 6:3\n\nWhat a joy it is to do a good deed!

  "03-04": "Eating to excess is a vice just as bad as many others. We often do not notice it in others, because most of us are subject to it.\n\nThere are sins against others, and sins against yourself. You commit sins against others when you do not respect God’s spirit in them; you commit sins against yourself when you do not respect God’s spirit in yourself. One of the most common sins against yourself is gluttony.\n\nA person who overeats cannot fight laziness; and a lazy man cannot fight sexual dissipation. All spiritual teachings start with restrictions, with control of the appetite.\n\nGod gave food to people, and the devil gave cooks.\n\nSocrates, a wise man, tried to abstain from all unnecessary things. He said that food should serve you in fighting your hunger, and not in developing sophisticated tastes, and he asked his students to follow his rule. He reminded his students about the wise Odysseus, whom Circe, an evil sorceress, could not subject to her magic, because he did not eat to excess. But the members of his crew, his friends, were turned into a herd of pigs by her as soon as they rushed to the abundance of sweet food.\n\nLook at your mouth; through it, when you eat to excess, illnesses enter your body. Behave in such a way that when you finish your dinner, you want to eat a little more.\n\nEating to excess is not considered to be a sin by many, because it produces no noticeable harm. But there are sins which destroy human dignity, and eating to excess is one such sin.",

It is better to be a blind man than to see only yourself and nobody else.\n\n—MUSLIH-UD-DIN SAADI\n\nHe who always listens to what other people say about him will never find inner peace.\n\nA flatterer speaks his flattery because he has a low opinion of himself and of others.\n\n—JEAN DE LA BRUYÈRE\n\nIf you want to preserve your good name, do not praise yourself and do not so much as allow others to praise you.",
  "03-06": "Love of God is love in itself; it is love for the sake of love. This kind of love is the highest blessing. It does not allow the slightest possibility of treating even a single creature without love; if there is even one person whom you do not love, then you lose God’s love and blessing.\n\nLove of your neighbor without love of God is a plant without roots. You should love God—this love is a real and firm love. It does not become weaker, only stronger, and it gives good to those who have it.\n\nSome say that you should be afraid of God. Not true; you have to love God. How can you love those whom you are afraid of? God is love, and how can you be afraid of love? No, you should not fear God, but love Him. And if you love God, then you will not be afraid of Him, or anything else in the world.",

A man can force others to do things for him, but he cannot free himself from the necessity of his own physical work. And if a man does not work at necessary and good things, then he will work at unnecessary and stupid things.\n\nWork, the process of work in itself, is the most important thing for us, and its reward should be of minor importance; if it is, you please your creator, God. If the reward is of major importance for you, and the work itself of minor importance, then you are the slave of the reward and its creator, the devil, and even the lowest and the least among all devils.\n\n—JOHN RUSKIN\n\nA European praised the advantages of mechanized labor to a Chinese man: “This invention relieves a man from the need for physical work.” But the Chinese man replied, “Physical work is good. Being relieved from physical work will be an enormous disaster.”\n\nEvery physical labor makes a man more noble. If you do not teach your son some physical skills, you teach him to rob others.\n\n—After the TALMUD\n\nWithout exercise of their muscles, neither man nor animal can live.\n\nSo that this exercise may give you joy and satisfaction, do good physical work. This is also the best way to serve others.",

If you cannot collect your thoughts, better not to pray, because you should always pray with your heart, not simply repeat words with your tongue.\n\nIt is good and necessary to pray in solitude, but is also good to pray when you are in the crowd, when you are excited or irritated—to think about your soul and about God.\n\nDo not think that you can please God with prayer. You will please God by submitting to Him. Prayer is just a reminder for you of who you are and what the purpose of your life is.",

We are all members of one great body.\n\nNature created us related to each other, from the same material, for the same purpose. Because of this, somewhere within all of us is mutual love for each other.\n\n—LUCIUS ANNAEUS SENECA\n\nThere is only one right pathway of life. Sooner or later, we all will meet each other on this pathway. The understanding of it is very clearly inscribed in our hearts, and it is wide and easy to find. At the end of this way is God, and He calls us to Himself.

  "03-11": "Food is necessary for the life of an individual, and marriage is necessary for the life of humanity. If eating to excess is evil for an individual, then excess in marriage and sexuality creates evil both for individuals and for human society.\n\nA marriage is a special obligation between two people, of opposite sexes, to have children only with each other. To break this pact is a lie, a deception, and a crime.\n\nIt is a great thing when two souls are united to support each other in their work, in their successes and misfortunes, until the last silent minutes of the last good-bye.\n\n—GEORGE ELIOT\n\nThe Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n\n—MATTHEW 19:3-6\n\nThe unification of a man and a woman for the continuation of humankind is a great and important deed for every individual, as well as for all mankind. You cannot do it as it pleases you, or as you like it. You have to do it in the way which was thought and set out by the wise and holy people who have lived before us.",
  "03-12": "The deeds of a person become his life, become his fate. This is the law of our life.\n\nThe Persians have such a fable: After death, a soul flew into the sky, and met a terrible woman, a dirty and horrible apparition, with festered sores discharging pus, who was going in the opposite direction. “What are you doing here?” asked the soul. “Who are you?” The terrible woman answered, “I am your deeds.”\n\nIt is important not only to talk about the good life but to do good things.\n\n—After the TALMUD\n\nNever postpone a good deed which you can do now, because death does not choose whether you have or haven’t done the things you should have done. Death waits for nobody and nothing. It has neither enemies, nor friends.\n\n—INDIAN WISDOM\n\nWhen you appeared in this world, you cried, and all the people around you rejoiced. You have to live your life in such a way that when you leave this world, you will rejoice, and all the people around you will cry.\n\n—INDIAN WISDOM\n\nYour past deeds weigh heavily on the future direction of your life; but sometimes, you can change this direction through the effort of your spirit.",

They think about everything except what is most important. They think about dancing, music, and singing; they think about houses, wealth, and power; they are jealous about the wealth of rich people and kings; but they do not think at all about what it means to be human.\n\n—After BLAISE PASCAL\n\nOne of the major responsibilities of a person is to make that intellectual spark which you have received from heaven illuminate the world around you.\n\n—CHINESE WISDOM\n\nEverything in this world is the manifestation of the divine intellect.\n\nAll that we know, we know through the intellect.

  "03-16": "Modern science cannot study everything; without being supported by religion, science does not know what it should study.\n\nReal wisdom is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of which things in life are necessary, which are less necessary, and which are completely unnecessary to know. Among the most necessary knowledge is the knowledge of how to live well, that is, how to produce the least possible evil and the greatest goodness in one’s life. At present, people study useless sciences, but forget to study this, the most important knowledge.\n\n—After JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU\n\nA person who knows little likes to talk, and one who knows much mostly keeps silent.\n\nThis is because a person who knows little thinks that everything he knows is important, and wants to tell everyone. A person who knows much also knows that there is much more he doesn’t know. That’s why he speaks only when it is necessary to speak, and when he is not asked questions, he keeps his silence.\n\nIf all knowledge were good, then pursuit of every sort of knowledge would be useful. But many false meditations are disguised as good and useful knowledge; therefore, be strict in selecting the knowledge you want to acquire.",

All social activity cannot really improve our social life if it is not based on the foundations established by religion.\n\nThe apostles lived united, in such a way that they shared one heart and soul. If they had not, no one today would know about Christianity. When some pagans did not accept Christianity, it was because they did not see complete unification and love among Christians. We Christians are to blame when other people do not accept the Christian faith.\n\n—After SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM\n\nChristianity in its pure and sincere form works like dynamite: it blows up old mountains and opens up new, limitless horizons.\n\nIf you see that some aspect of your society is bad, and you want to improve it, there is only one way to do so: you have to improve people. And in order to improve people, you begin with only one thing: you can become better yourself.",
  "03-18": "Blaming other people is always wrong, because no one knows what has happened and happens in the soul of another person.\n\nWe often make judgments about other people. We call one person kind, the other stupid, the third evil, the fourth clever. But we should not do so. A man changes constantly; he flows like a river, and every new day he differs from what he was before. He was stupid and became clever; he was evil and became kind at heart; and so on. You cannot judge another person. The moment you blame him, he becomes someone different.\n\nIf you want to correct your failings, you do not have the time to waste in blaming other people.\n\nNever blame your neighbor until you have been in his place.\n\n—The TALMUD\n\nForgive other people for many things, but do not forgive yourself anything.\n\n—PUBLILIUS SYRUS\n\nI know of myself that I do not wish to do evil. If I do evil, it is because I cannot restrain myself. It is the same with other people: they usually do evil because they cannot restrain themselves from evil.

It was a terrible sight. Everywhere there was blood, pieces of flesh, bodies with heads torn away, the smell of blood so strong it made even the most tough and hardest men dizzy. The armored cannon tower suffered most of all. A shell exploded on top of it and killed a young officer who was the chief of the ship’s artillery. Only one thing was left of the poor man; it was his fist, the hand which held the instrument. Two of four sailors who stood next to their commander were torn into pieces, and the other two had terrible injuries; afterwards both had their legs amputated, and then the remains of their legs were cut off again completely.

And weak and false thoughts may be found in books which have come to be considered great, or even sacred.\n\nMany statements which are accepted as truth because they have been passed down to us by tradition look like truth only because we have never tested them, never thought about them in a more precise way.\n\nFor the majority of mankind, religion is a habit, or, more precisely, tradition is their religion. Though it seems strange, I think that the first step to moral perfection is your liberation from the religion in which you were raised.

Everything begins in thought. Guiding your thoughts is one of the keys to self-perfection.

He answered, “The most important time is the present time, because at this time a person has power over himself. The most important person is the one with whom you deal at present, because there is no guarantee that you will ever be able to deal with any other person in this world. The most important thing is to love this person, because everyone is sent into this world with the sole purpose of loving other people.”\n\nOnly when we use every minute of our life will we know that we are eternal.\n\n—HARRIET MARTINEAU\n\nA most dangerous temptation is the temptation to prepare to live, instead of living.

We possess within us two different ways of understanding this world. One is the feeling of being divided, distanced, and alienated from each other; in this state, all things seem gloomy to us. We feel nothing except jealousy, indifference, and hatred. I would like to call the opposite way of understanding the understanding of universal unification. In this state, all people seem very close to us, and all are equal among themselves.

I address God as if He were a person, though I know it is not so.\n\nA person buried in a deep mine, freezing from the cold in deep ice, dying from hunger alone on the open sea, wasting away in solitude in a prison cell, or simply dying at home, deaf and blind—how could this person live out the remainder of his life if prayer did not exist?\n\nHow good a person feels when, exhausted from striving for goodness in his everyday life, he stretches out his hands to God.\n\n—BLAISE PASCAL\n\nOne can live without prayer either when he is possessed by his passions or when his life is completely dedicated to God. But for a person who is fighting his passion and yet far from fulfilling his duty, prayer is a necessary condition of life.",
  "12-22": "Nothing seems to check the notion that the way to improve civilization is affected by changing its outer forms. This notion is false, and draws the activity of too many people away from effort that truly can improve our lives.\n\nCivilization is first of all a moral thing. Without truth, respect for duty, love of neighbor, virtue, everything is destroyed. The morality of a society is alone the basis of civilization.\n\n—HENRI AMIEL\n\nThe proper direction of man’s thought is not toward the creation of new laws for government, but toward the acceptance of every person’s moral dignity.\n\n—EDMUND YATES\n\nSocialism, when compared with Christianity, is a rather minor, secondary question about the material needs of the working class. It stands outside the basic questions of human life.\n\n—FYODOR STRAKHOV\n\nWe should, first of all, understand that we are all children of the same father, and we should fulfill the same general law: live not for ourselves, but to help others be happy.\n\n—GIUSEPPE MAZZINI\n\nWhen we accept false and violent laws and submit to them, we can neither establish truth nor combat lies in this world.",
  "12-23": "Wisdom is understanding how eternal truth can be applied to life.\n\nSocrates was the first who brought philosophy from heaven, distributed it among the people, and enticed them to study the science of life, human morals, and the consequences of good and evil.\n\nScience is seldom connected with wisdom. A scholarly person knows many unnecessary things. A wise person knows few things, but all that he knows is necessary both for humanity and for himself.\n\nHe who understands his soul will understand the divine spark within himself.\n\n—MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO\n\nWise people cannot be sufficiently educated, and educated people cannot be sufficiently wise.\n\n—LAO-TZU\n\nThe goodness given to us by wisdom compares to all other knowledge in the same way that in a desert, a vessel filled with water compares to mountains of gold.",
  "12-24": "Starting from early childhood, as we age we feel the growth of our spiritual power and the diminution of our physical power.\n\nOlder people who live spiritual lives ever widen their spiritual horizons, and ever expand their consciences. Older people who live only a daily routine become more and more stupid over the years.\n\n—The TALMUD\n\nOne becomes older in order to become kinder; there is no mistake which I have not already made.\n\n—JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\n\nThe growth and development of the soul is more important than power and glory.\n\n—HENRI AMIEL\n\nThe growth of our physical energy prepares us for spiritual work, for serving God and mankind; this work starts when our body begins to fade away.\n\nGrow spiritually and help others to do so; it is the meaning of life.\n\nTerrible is the situation of those who cannot perceive spiritual growth in themselves. They can see only physical life, which will disappear in time.\n\nWhen you understand your spiritual being and live with it, then instead of despairing you understand the joy that can never be destroyed, which always grows.",
  "12-25": "Kindness and virtue come from the heart, and should be performed without thought for the opinion of others, or of future rewards.\n\nVirtue and charity start at home. If you have to go somewhere to display it, then it is not virtue.\n\nAssistance given to the poor by the rich is too often just a gesture of politeness, not real charity.\n\nCharity is good only when it comes as a sacrifice; only then do those who receive the material gift receive the spiritual gift too. If it is not a sacrifice but a discharge of excess, it can only irritate those who receive it.",
  "12-26": "Childhood is the period in which underlying convictions are formed. Therefore, the most important part of education is the selection of the things of which a child should be convinced.\n\nTalking and reasoning does not even have one thousandth the influence a true example has. All lessons about how to behave are worthless when children see the opposite in real life.\n\nWhat use is it for children when people only speak about goodness, but perform bad deeds in reality?\n\n—GUSTAV STRUVE\n\nThe strong desire for a pleasant and ideal life is a child’s worst misfortune. It is crucial that children should know how to work from an early age.\n\n—IMMANUEL KANT\n\nIt is important to teach children kindness and simplicity in life and work. All of children’s moral and spiritual education should be supported by your own good example. You should live virtuously, or at least try to do so; the success of your good life will educate your children.",
  "12-27": "All that we see and know does not exist in reality, because it is the product of our limited ability to understand reality.\n\nInstead of saying that the world is reflected in our intellect, better to say that our intellect is reflected in the world.\n\n—GEORGE LICHTENBERG\n\nOld fortresses are destroyed, monuments to kings are demolished, old age ravages our bodies. Only the teachings of kindness are never ruined or affected by age.\n\nAs soon as a person truly looks at himself as only a physical body, then he sees an unsolved puzzle, a contradiction that cannot be unraveled.\n\nIn order to understand the true essence of a thing we must transform the physical into the spiritual.",
  "12-28": "Science is vitally important when it is harnessed to reveal the law of human life.\n\nIn order to accept the importance of science, we must prove that this activity is useful. Scientists usually demonstrate that they are doing something and that maybe sometime, someday, this could be useful for people in the future.\n\nThe universe is limitless, and impossible for anyone to understand. Therefore, we cannot completely understand the life of our own body.\n\n—BLAISE PASCAL\n\n“Science” is not quite the concept which people use this word to identify; it is the highest, most important, most necessary object of our understanding.",
  "12-29": "As long as there is violence, there will be war. One cannot defeat violence with more violence, only with nonresistance to and nonparticipation in it.\n\n—LETURNO\n\nIf my soldiers started thinking, not a single soldier would remain in my army.\n\n—FREDERICK II\n\nThe wild instinct of military murder has developed in humanity over the course of thousands of years, and has become rooted in our brains. We must hope that our society will be able to rid itself of this terrible crime.\n\nWith time I understand the army code that dictates that a sergeant is always right when he addresses a soldier, that a lieutenant is always right when he addresses a sergeant, and so on up to generals and marshals, even when a person says that two times two equals five. If you do not obey your superior, you are punished by death, or years in prison.\n\n—EDWARD EKMAN\n\nWars can be stopped only if people are ready to be persecuted for not participating in them. This is the only way.",
  "12-30": "The understanding of the fraternity and equality of all people becomes more and more popular among mankind.\n\nDo we understand our spiritual fraternity? Do we understand that we originated from one divine Father whose image we carry in ourselves and for whose perfection we strive? Have we accepted that there is the same divine life in all people, as well as in ourselves? And that this makes a natural and free bond among people?\n\n—WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING\n\nWe can love neither those whom we fear nor those who fear us.\n\n—MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO\n\nFamily and motherland are but two circles that are part of the wider circle that is humanity. Those who teach morality and who limit one’s duties only to family and country teach a selfishness which is dangerous for all of us.\n\nThe understanding of one’s unity with all of humanity comes from the understanding of the divine beginning in us all, and gives all our greatest good. True religion creates this understanding, and different prejudices interfere with it—prejudice of state, nation, and class.",
  "12-31": "The past does not exist. The future has not begun. The present is an infinitely small point in time in which the already nonexistent past meets the imminent future. At this point, which is timeless, a person’s real life exists.\n\n“Time passes by!” we say. Time does not exist; only we move.\n\n—After the TALMUD\n\nTime is behind us, time is before us, but in the present there is no time.\n\nI consist of spirit and body. Time affects the body, but the life of the spirit has no meaning either in the past or in the future. All its life is concentrated in the present.\n\n—MARCUS AURELIUS\n\nDivine spirit is eternal, it exists out of time. Limitless time and space are divided into small, limited parts to be used by limited beings.\n\n—HENRI AMIEL\n\nThe soul is put into our body, so that it can understand the notion of date and time. It contemplates this fact and calls it “nature.”\n\n—BLAISE PASCAL\n\nTime does not exist. There is only a small and infinite present, and it is only in this present that our life occurs. Therefore, a person should concentrate all his spiritual force only on this present.\n\nOceanofPDF.com"
